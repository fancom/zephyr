    STM32 OSPI device representation. A stm32 octospi node would typically
    looks to this:

      &octospi1 {
        pinctrl-0 = <
          &octospi_clk_pb2
          &octospi_ncs_pg6
          &octospi_bk1_io0_pd11
          &octospi_bk1_io1_pc10
          &octospi_bk1_io2_pe2
          &octospi_bk1_io3_pd13
        >;

        status = "okay";
        clock-port = <1>;
        ncs-port = <1>;
        io-low-port = <1>;
      }

compatible: "st,stm32-ospi"

include: base.yaml

bus: ospi

properties:
    reg:
      required: true

    interrupts:
      required: true

    dmas:
      description: |
        Optional DMA channel specifier. If DMA should be used, specifier should
        hold a phandle reference to the dma controller, the channel number,
        the slot number, channel configuration and finally features.

        For example dmas for TX/RX on QSPI
           dmas = <&dma1 5 5 0x0000 0x03>;

    dma-names:
      description: |
        DMA channel name. If DMA should be used, expected value is "tx_rx".

        For example
           dma-names = "tx_rx";

    pinctrl-0:
      type: phandles
      required: true

    chip-select-boundary:
      type: int
      default: 0
      description: |
        It enables the transaction boundary feature and
        defines the boundary of bytes to release the chip select.
        This parameter can be a value between 0 and 31.

    clock-port:
      type: int
      required: true
      description : |
        It indicates which port of the OSPI IO Manager is used for the CLK pins.
        This parameter can be a value between 1 and 8

    ncs-port:
      type: int
      required: true
      description: |
        It indicates which port of the OSPI IO Manager is used for the NCS pin.
        This parameter can be a value between 1 and 8

    dqs-port:
      type: int
      default: 0
      description: |
        It indicates which port of the OSPI IO Manager is used for the DQS pin.
        This parameter can be a value between 0 and 8, 0 means that signal not used

    io-low-port:
      type: int
      default: 0
      description: |
        It indicates which port of the OSPI IO Manager is used for the IO[3:0] pins.

    io-high-port:
      type: int
      default: 0
      description: |
        It indicates which port of the OSPI IO Manager is used for the IO[7:4] pins.

    req-2-ack-time:
      type: int
      default: 1
      description: |
        It indicates the minimum switching duration (in number of clock cycles) expected
        if some signals are multiplexed in the OSPI IO Manager with the other OSPI.
        This parameter can be a value between 1 and 256
