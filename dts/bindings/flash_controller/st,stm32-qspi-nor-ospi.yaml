    STM32 OSPI Flash controller supporting the JEDEC CFI interface by
    mimicking a QSPI controller.

    Representation of a serial flash on a octospi bus:

      &octospi1 {
        pinctrl-0 = <
              &octospi_clk_pb2
              &octospi_ncs_pg6
              &octospi_bk1_io0_pd11
              &octospi_bk1_io1_pc10
              &octospi_bk1_io2_pe2
              &octospi_bk1_io3_pd13
          >;

          status = "okay";
          clock-port = <1>;
          ncs-port = <1>;
          io-low-port = <0x10001>;
